Thanks for downloading Gessource!

In gessource you build up a factory to extract and sell ressources.
There might not be much yet and I don't really plan serious development.
This project was intended as a small practice to learn java.
Talking about java, you'll need a java sdk to run the program, there are alot of tutorials online, good luck!

Controls:
Enter: Progress in time

Commands:

production [ressource] [number]
-> changes how much of the ressource you are producing with the cost of storage capacity
IMPORTANT: the number in the command doesnt set the number of the ressource you produce, it increases/decreases it

sell_amount [ressource] [number]
->sets how much of your ressource you are selling

factory_upgrade
->increases your factory capacity by 1


stats:
Wood (Production_Cost: 1000 Sell_cost: 1100)
Iron (Production_Cost: 4000 Sell_cost: 5000)
Silver (Production_Cost: 20000 Sell_cost: 25000)
Gold (Production_Cost: 50000 Sell_cost: 60000)
Platinum (Production_Cost: 250000 Sell_cost: 300000)

chance to unlock iron: 1% per cycle
chance to unlock silver: 0.2% per cycle
chance to unlock gold: 0.05% per cycle
chance to unlock platinum: 0.001% per cycle

factory_upgrade cost is 10000xcurrentcapacity
