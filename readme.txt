Thanks for downloading Gessource!

In gessource you build up a factory to extract and sell ressources.
There might not be much yet and I don't really plan serious development.
This project was intended as a small practice to learn java.
Talking about java, you'll need a java sdk to run the program, there are alot of tutorials online, good luck!

Controls:
Enter: Progress in time

Commands:

production
->shows how much ressources you are extracting and how much of it you are selling

capacity
-> Shows your factory overall capacity and capacity left to extract more ressources

wood_production [number]
-> changes how much wood you are producing with the cost of storage capacity
IMPORTANT: the number in the command doesnt set the number of wood you produce, it increases/decreases it

wood_sell_amount [number]
->sets how much of your wood you are selling

factory_upgrade
->increases your factory capacity by 1


stats:
wood production costs 1000
wood price is 1100
factory_upgrade cost is 10000xcurrentcapacity
